    <h2>Proyecto Ecocycle</h2>
    <p>
        The Ecocycle projectâ€™s primary goal is to develop a circular economy model that not only reduces waste generation but also fosters a culture of sustainability within the community. In a context where the amount of waste generated increases each year and natural resources are depleting at alarming rates, Ecocycle emerges as an innovative and mindful response to the current environmental crisis.
    <p>
        This project seeks to transform the way the community interacts with its resources and waste, promoting practices that help keep these resources in use for as long as possible through recycling, reuse, and material recovery.:
